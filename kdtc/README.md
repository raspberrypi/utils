# kdtc

`kdtc` is a wrapper around `dtc` (the Device Tree compiler) that passes input files through `cpp` (the C preprocessor) first, in order to resolve any #include directives or expand any #define macros. When run without any `dtc` options, `kdtc` attempts to detect the input format and do the right thing.

**Build Instructions**

Install the prerequisites with "sudo apt install cmake device-tree-compiler" - you need at least version 3.10 of cmake. Run the following commands, either here or in the top-level directory to build and install everything:

 - *cmake .*
 - *sudo make install*

**Usage**
```
Usage: kdtc [<opts>] [<infile> [<outfile>]]
  where <opts> can be any of:

    -h|--help            Show this help message
    -i|--include <path>  Add a path to search for include files
    -k|--kerndir <path>  The path to the kernel tree
    -n|--just-print      Just show the command that would be executed
    -w|--warnings        Don't suppress common dtc warnings

  or any dtc options (see 'dtc -h')

  When run with no dtc options, kdtc detects the input format and attempts
  to do the right thing.

If run within a git kernel source tree, the kerndir path is inferred.
